This is a custom WordPress plugin to integrate with Northeastern's Solr
index and query items from the Fedora digital repository.  It has been
extended to interact specifically with objects from NCIEC's digital
repository but can be used with generic objects or extended to be used
with any DRS item.

It relies on two other open source projects which are embedded in this plugin:

    1. ajax-solr
       https://github.com/evolvingweb/ajax-solr
       Javascript client to provide the faceted searching of the solr index.

    2. solr-php-client
       https://code.google.com/p/solr-php-client/
       Used to as a proxy for ajax-solr to reach the IP restricted NU server

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
