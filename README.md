This repository contains the plugins and custom themes for the DRS Project Toolkit. The main plugin which provides search, browse, display, and media library import is at plugins/drs-tk. The current implementation of a custom theme is a child theme of Minamaze and is located at themes/minamaze-child. The parent theme Minamaze must be present at /wp-content/themes/minamaze for the child theme to work.
